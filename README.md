## Overview

After receiving a grant by my university to study in Aarhus, Denmark I wanted to make sure I made the most of this opportunity. I am currently about to go into my third year studying Creative Computing at University of the Arts London but wanted to do something to further my studies during the summer. I applied through my university to study a two week course learning software design in C++ with the creator the language, Bjarne Stroupstup at Aarhus Unviversity. Coding is a passion and great interest of mine so I was incredibly excited for this opportunity. As I had never been to Denmark before I also took this time as a chance to get to know the city and be a tourist. Browse my page to find out about everything I did!
